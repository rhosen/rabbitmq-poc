# Service Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the service implemented in the `Service1` class. It describes the service's purpose, initialization process, message consumption and production, as well as logging functionality. The documentation aims to assist future developers in understanding the code and its functionality.

## Introduction

The service is designed to facilitate communication between an application and a client. It uses RabbitMQ as the message broker and implements a simple message exchange mechanism.

The service receives messages from the client application and sends messages to the application. The `Service1` class extends the `ServiceBase` class, allowing it to be run as a Windows service. The class is responsible for initializing the service, handling message consumption from the application, sending messages to the application, and logging relevant events.

## Initialization

The initialization section of the code sets up the connection to the RabbitMQ server. It defines class-level variables `_connection` of type `IConnection` and `_channel` of type `IModel` to interact with the RabbitMQ server. The `InitializeConnection` method establishes the connection and creates the channel.

The RabbitMQ server is assumed to be running on the local machine, with the hostname set to `localhost`.

The `OnStart` method is overridden to start the service. It calls the `InitializeLogWriter` method to initialize the log file writer, then calls the `InitializeConnection` method to establish the connection with the RabbitMQ server. It further starts the message consumption process by calling the `StartMessageConsumption` method. Finally, it awaits the `SendMessageToClientAfterDelay` method to send a scheduled message to the client application.

The `OnStop` method is overridden to stop the service. It closes the channel and connection with the RabbitMQ server and closes the log file writer.

## Message Consumption

The service consumes messages sent by the client application using the `StartMessageConsumption` method. This method declares a queue named `_applicationToServiceQueue` and sets up a message consumer to receive messages from this queue.

The `ProcessReceivedMessage` method is triggered when a message is received. It retrieves the message from the `BasicDeliverEventArgs` object, logs the received message, and acknowledges the receipt by calling `_channel.BasicAck`.

## Message Production

The service can send messages to the client application using the `SendMessageToApplication` method. By default, the method sends the message "Hello, application!" to the application.

The `SendMessageToClientAfterDelay` method continuously sends the specified message to the client application after a specified time interval. It uses the `SendMessageToApplication` method and awaits a delay using `Task.Delay`. The default delay is set to 30 seconds.

The service declares a queue named `_serviceToApplicationQueue` before sending the message to the application. It then publishes the message using `_channel.BasicPublish`.

## Logging

The service provides logging functionality using the `InitializeLogWriter`, `CloseLogWriter`, and `LogMessage` methods.

The `InitializeLogWriter` method sets up the log file path and creates a `StreamWriter` to write log messages. It appends log messages to the existing log file if it already exists.

The `CloseLogWriter` method closes the log file writer and disposes of its resources.

The `LogMessage` method appends log messages to the log file. It formats log messages with a timestamp and the provided message. The log file is flushed after writing each log message
